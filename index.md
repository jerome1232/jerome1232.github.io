    * Utilized Python scripting and Unix Domain Sockets to facilitate communication between web ui and Arduino.
__What was the end result? How many hours of labor did this save? Were the plants healthier? I know this is already 4 bullets long, but having a snippet that says "and these were the results" might help.__

  * **Covid-19 Tracker**: [C19](https://github.com/jerome1232/C19)

    * Developed a Covid-19 tracking app as part of a team for Android using Kotlin.
    * Utilized three JSON api endpoints to find the data requested whether it be a state or country.
    * Primarily resolved data requests, also debugged various ui issues. __less words = clearer__
    * Collaborated remotely using Git and Bitbucket. __I don't know bitbucket, but I feel like Git would be the more prominent tool.__
__Is there a link to this one?__

  * **Data Structure Tutorial**: [DataStruct-Tutorial](https://jerome1232.github.io/datastruct-tut/)
